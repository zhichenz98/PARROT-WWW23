## How to use
Directly run matlab files in the experiments folder to reproduce results in the paper.
For further use, a matfile is requried for each alignment task, including the following components:
- A1/A2: two adjacency matrices with shape [n1,n1], [n2,n2] for two networks.
- X1/X2: two node attribute matrices with shape [n1,d], [n2,d] for two networks. Use empty matrices for plain networks.
- H: anchor node set with shape [n2,n1] where H(i,j) indicates node j in G1 is aligned with node i in G2.
- gnd: ground-truth alignement with shape=[m,2] where the first column is the node index in G1 and the second column is the node index in G2.
